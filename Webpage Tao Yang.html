                <p> <b id="Bold-black"> Baoding </b>is a city with a history dating back to the Western Han Dynasty. It
                    was destroyed by the
                    Mongols in the 13th century, but after the Mongols established the Yuan Dynasty, it was rebuilt. It
                    acquired the name "Baoding" during the Yuan dynasty — the name is roughly interpreted as "protecting
                    the capital", referring to the city's proximity to Beijing. Baoding served for many years as the
                    capital of Zhili, and was a significant centre of culture in the Ming Dynasty and early Qing
                    Dynasty. During the Boxer rebellion, Boxer rebels killed a Turk, two Swiss, and an Italian in
                    Baoding.</p>
                <p>On August 1, 1949, the people's Government of Hebei province was established, Baoding was the
                    capital of the province, and the city of Baoding was a provincial municipality. On August 9, the
                    administrative inspector's office of the Baoding district was established, and it was established as
                    the administrative inspector's office of the county district.</p>
                <p>In May 1958, the capital of Hebei was moved to Tianjin. <br>
                    In January 1966, the provincial capital was moved from Tianjin to Baoding. <br>
                    In February 1968, the provincial capital moved to Shijiazhuang. <br>
                    In December 1994, the Baoding area merged with Baoding to become a provincial city. <br>
                    In April 2017, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council announced
                    the decision to transform Baoding's Xiong, Rongcheng, and Anxin counties into Xiong'an New Area, a
                    new development area of national significance, with a focus on innovation, sustainability and
                    quality of life, following the success of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and Shanghai's Pudong New
                    Area.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the best-known item to supposedly originate in Baoding are Baoding Balls, which can be used
                    to relax one's keyboard hand and strengthen one's wrist. The most famous local specialty food is the
                    Donkey Burger (Chinese: 驴肉火烧). <br>
                    Anxin County is home to the Quantou Village Music Association (圈头村音乐会), a well known traditional
                    music group performing on guan (oboes), sheng (mouth organs), and percussion. The village of Quantou

                    The city's streets follow a rough grid pattern, although this is less obvious in the older part of
                    the city. The traditional main street of old Baoding is Yuhua Road, running from the city's centre
                    to its eastern edge — most of Baoding's historic buildings are located in this area, along with some
                    of its larger shopping centres. Other major streets include Dongfeng Road and Chaoyang Avenue. There
                    is a ring road around the city. <br>
                    Baoding is home to Hebei University, North China Electric Power University with other 3 universities

                    Baoding contains a number of notable historic sites. In the city proper, there can be found a
                    historic provincial governor's mansion and an ancient lotus garden. In the hills to the northwest of
                    the city, near the suburb of Mancheng, there are the Mancheng Han Tombs, where Prince Liu Sheng and
                    his wife Dou Wan were buried.<br>

                    south. Baoding also borders Beijing to the northeast and Shanxi to the west. </p>
                <p>Elevations in Baoding's administrative area decrease from northwest to southeast. The western parts
                    are dominated by mountains and hills that are generally more than 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) tall; this
                    area includes parts of Laishui, Yi, Mancheng, Shunping, Tang and Fuping Counties as well as the
                    entirety of Laiyuan County, occupying 30.6% of the prefecture's area. The highest peak is Mount
                    Waitou (歪头山), with an elevation of 2,286 metres (7,500 ft). Moving southeast from this area, one
                    encounters low-lying mountains and hills, taking up 18.9% of the prefecture's area.Further to
                    the east lies generally flat terrain of 30 to 100 metres (98 to 330 ft) elevation. Here the primary
                    rivers are the Juma, Yishui (易水), Cao (漕河), Longquan (龙泉河), Tang (唐河), and Sha Rivers. Baiyangdian
